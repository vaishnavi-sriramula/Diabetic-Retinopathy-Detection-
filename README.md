# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-

## 📝 Project Overview

This project aims to **detect diabetic retinopathy** using various supervised machine learning models trained on features extracted from retinal fundus images. Early diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy can help prevent vision loss in diabetic patients.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract meaningful features from retinal images.
- Train multiple machine learning classifiers for severity detection.
- Compare model performance and select the most accurate one.
